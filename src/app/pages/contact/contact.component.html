                <p>I focus on balance. I love baking and eating (all types of food) but I also love feeling
                  healthy and strong. I never restrict anything in my eating and focus on balance, mindful eating.
                  Being active is fun for me. I don’t look at a workout as something I have to do, I do it
                  because I want to. I find workouts and activities that I enjoy and usually do them with friends.
                  I love the workout plans from @fitmamametta and the HIIT workout from @high.fitness.
                  I also run, do Pilates reformer, and spin classes. Variety is key! I wrote a post about
                  this one time, you can find it below!</p>

                  DO I REALLY NEED PARCHMENT PAPER?</label></h6>

              <div class="content">
                <p>Parchment paper is an essential baking tool because it creates a nonstick surface. If
                  you want cakes to release cleanly, brownies to lift out of the pan, and cookies to slide
                  off the sheet, parchment paper is a must. It can be a little pricey, but it’s also
                  available in pretty much every baking aisle and is 100% worth it—way better than having
                  a cake that you worked so hard on refuse to come out of the pan.</p>

                <p>Best case scenario is to own both. They definitely both have a time and a place in the

                  small business from your kitchen, you can probably get away with owning a hand mixer
                  until your budget allows for you to invest in a stand mixer.</p>
